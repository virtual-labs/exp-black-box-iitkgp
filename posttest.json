What is the resistance of this shunt, in ohms? <br/><p style=\"text-align:center\"><img src=\"images/ohmq2.png\"></p><br/>Shunt resistors are often used as current-measuring devices, in that they are designed to drop very precise amounts of voltage as large electric currents pass through them. By measuring the amount of voltage dropped by a shunt resistor, you will be able to determine the amount of current going through it:",
